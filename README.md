### Hey! 🙋🏻‍♂️

I'm a web developer by profession and coder/novice solderer of other stuff by hobby.

### Currently working on:

- 🌎  [Traveling](https://www.johnheher.com/trip) to all Olympic sites.
- 🔎 Breaking my brain getting into 3D development.
- 💡 Automating things to ultimately allow me to be as lazy as possible (For as we know, that's is the American dream 🇺🇸🫡).

If you're interested in those or looking for some development work, feel free to [email me](mailto:johnheher@gmail.com).
