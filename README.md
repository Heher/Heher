<h2>Hey! 🙋🏻‍♂️</h2>

<p>I'm a web developer by profession and coder/novice solderer of other stuff by hobby.</p>

<h3>Currently working on:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>🌎 <a href="https://www.johnheher.com/trip">Traveling</a> to all Olympic sites.</li>
  <li>🔎 Breaking my brain getting into 3D development.</li>
  <li>💡 Automating things to ultimately allow me to be as lazy as possible (For as we know, that's is the American dream 🇺🇸🫡).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested in those or looking for some development work, feel free to <a href="mailto:johnheher@gmail.com">email me</a>.</p>
